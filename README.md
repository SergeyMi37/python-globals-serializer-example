The aim of this project is to show how to use IRIS globals to support Python dictionary collection for the [InterSystems Globals Contest](https://community.intersystems.com/post/intersystems-globals-contest). This means that the actual Python dictionary data is stored in IRIS database rather than memory, which lets your code deal with big contents while having quick access to their items.
